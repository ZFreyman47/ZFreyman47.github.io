							<h3>Citrus Racing Teaching and Media</h3>
							<p>In the year between CR4 competing and CR5's upcoming competition this spring, the leadership of the 
								team and I put considerable effort into expanding the team in both size and educational capabilities.
							Thanks to a few key members joining the team on the media and marketing division, we were well equipped to 
							begin assembling a set of informational video shorts to post on our social media profiles. This has allowed 
							prospective new members as well as anyone outside the university following our accounts to gain a basic 
							understanding of a few key areas of vehcile engineering that go into building and tuning the car.</p>

							<h3>CR4</h3>
							<p>Joining in the beginning of my sophomore year, I wound up getting myself into what is to this day the single most significant 
								project that I've had the privilege of undertaking. Getting CR4 to competition at Michigan International Speedway was an 
								unbelievably unique set of engineering challenges that I will never encounter again but will be infinitely better prepared 
								for should I be wrong. Finishing a car that was designed and started by people I've still never met, with people I had only 
								just met, with only the experience of rebuilding an old motorcycle over a summer to educate me on the expansive field of 
								automotive engineering. Acting as the suspension lead in conjunction with the aforementioned group of people who have 
								rapidly become some of my closest friends, we assembled, tested, and competed with CR4, and produced the best FSAE Michigan 
								result Syracuse University has had in recent decades.</p>

							<h3>Raptor</h3>
							<p>
								I have been building and "engineering", since before I can remember. 
								However, the first significant example of a product of my own engineering comes from when I was finally old enough to get the 
								FAA's recreational UAV license at the age of 13. As a result of my age and finally saving enough money from mowing lawns and birthdays 
								to buy electronics, I ordered a myriad of parts following an online guide for how to build a racing drone. What followed was a 
								painfully long 5 month wait for overseas shipping to deliver my parts in three separate packages. Upon receiving the final box, 
								I watched the tutorial on YouTube for what must've been the hundredth time bolting the components together and soldering the now 
								long-ago upgraded stack of core electronics. Flying my drone, which I had by then nicknamed Raptor, for the first time was an 
								understandably nerve-racking experience. Luckily, I managed to keep from crashing right away and so began several days of tuning the 
								numerous PID control loop gains and rates to dial in the handling of my new racing machine. Oddly enough, even after achieving very 
								good performance from Raptor, I never used the vehicle for the racing it was spec'd for. I very quickly gravitated more towards using 
								it as a camera platform, another hobby of mine that I still enjoy to this day. I lost track of the major design iterations I 
								made to the vehicle right around the time I had it labeled as "Mk.14" in my transmitter and by that time had also built two other 
								FPV [first person view] UAVs for various other mission types. Jumping to present day, Raptor has most recently been employed as a 
								research vehicle in an experiment studying flocking bird behaviors in Professor Kasey Laurent's aerospace research lab at 
								Syracuse University.
